# MLOPS

What is MLOps?
**MLOps** stands for `Machine Learning Operations`. It contains a set of practices that aims to deploy and 
maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently


Machine learning models are developed, trained and tested in isolated experimental systems. When a model is ready to 
be deployed in a production environment, we need a standard operation procedure that can deploy the model efficiently 
and then maintaining and monitoring the model, or even retrain the model.

MLOps is a set of best practices that seeks to increase automation and improve the efficiency of models during
the whole ml lifecycle, while also focusing on business and regulatory requirements.  
 
MLOps applies to the entire lifecycle - from integrating with model code development ( 
continuous integration/continuous delivery), orchestration, and deployment, to health, diagnostics, governance, 
and business metrics. 


MLOps is practiced between Data Scientists, DevOps, and Machine Learning engineers
